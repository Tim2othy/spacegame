# How to play the game
If there is one player, move with arrow keys, shoot with space.

If there are two players:
- Player one moves with arrow keys, shoots with return,
- Player two moves with wasd, shoots with space.

You can toggle one and two player mode by setting `TEST_MODE` to `True` or `False` respectivly. This also changes the size of the world and whether one can die.

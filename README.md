Small game I'm making for fun. Give me feedback on the playing experience or on the way the code is written. Or just play it : )

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run with:
```
py main.py
```

Move with arrow keys, shoot with space, repair the ship with `m`, replenish fuel with `n`.

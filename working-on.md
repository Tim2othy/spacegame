# Code Hygiene
- Add docstrings where reasonable

# Bugs
- SCREEN_HEIGHT and WIDTH are only allowed to go up to 30_918
- higher restitution causes collisions to deal more damadge, which probably shouln't be the case
- 

# Obvious needs
- Give everything good collision detection and world border detection
- make it so that if two things bump into each other the speed of both is used in the calculation and not just the own speed (look into what the actual physics are)


# Future features
- Add images for ship and planets, take inspiration from the game defender
- background (also defender)
- Add simple sound effects (also defender)
- Create a main menu
- Clever homing missile
- slow scatter shot
- iron dome
- space dust that has drag
- Find out how to get more orbits to happen
- create test map and real map
- Asteroid belt


# Future Ideas
- Add missions
- Make Neural net / RL AI that's pretty clever
- Make it a coop game that two people play at the same time
